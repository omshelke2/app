      <h2>Step 1: Account Setup</h2>
      <p>Create a Google Play Console account by visiting the official Google Play Console registration page. Follow the instructions to set up your developer account and pay the one-time registration fee.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step-2">
      <h2>Step 2: App Preparation</h2>
      <p>Before publishing, ensure your Android app is ready by preparing the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design an appealing app icon that represents your app.</li>
        <li>Create high-quality screenshots showcasing different app features.</li>
        <li>Write a compelling app description that highlights its unique selling points.</li>
        <li>Provide a privacy policy if your app collects user data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="step-3">
      <h2>Step 3: App Release</h2>
      <p>Upload your app's APK or app bundle to the Google Play Console. Ensure you set the appropriate version code and target various device configurations. You can also opt for staged rollout or testing tracks for alpha and beta versions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step-4">
      <h2>Step 4: Content Rating</h2>
      <p>Complete the content rating questionnaire for your app. This step is essential to classify the app's content and ensure it's suitable for various audiences. Provide accurate responses to questions related to violence, nudity, and other sensitive content.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step-5">
      <h2>Step 5: Store Listing</h2>
      <p>Fill out the store listing details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add the app title, which should be clear and concise.</li>
        <li>Include the app description that elaborates on your app's features and functionality.</li>
        <li>Upload screenshots and promotional graphics to showcase your app visually.</li>
        <li>Consider adding a promo video to engage potential users.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="step-6">
      <h2>Step 6: Pricing and Distribution</h2>
      <p>Choose the pricing strategy for your app - free, paid, or with in-app purchases. Select the countries or regions where you want your app to be available for download.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step-7">
      <h2>Step 7: App Releases and Testing</h2>
      <p>If you have multiple app releases, manage them using the Google Play Console. You can create different tracks for alpha and beta testing, allowing you to gather feedback from a limited audience before a wider release.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="step-8">
      <h2>Step 8: Review and Publish</h2>
      <p>Review all the information carefully. Once you are satisfied that everything is accurate and complete, submit your app for review. The Google Play Store team will review your app to ensure it meets the policies and guidelines before making it available to users.</p>
